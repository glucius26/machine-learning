This decision tree and code automates the process of deciding if or if not one wants to purchase a game. It will ask you a series of questions that will easily determine if or if not you would like to purchase said game. No longer do you have to sit for minutes on end, going back and forth on whether or not it's worth it, or if you like it, or if you'll feel bad about it, or any of that!
